I am a PhD student at Univeristy of Victoria. 

My current research interests are any topics related to Galactic Archaeology, such as:
  * The formation, evolution, and accretion history of the Milky Way (MW),
  * The chemodynamics of resolved stellar populations in our Galaxy,
  * The MW's accreted satellite population (dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and even faint ambiguous star clusters),
  * The disruption of these satellites, i.e. stellar streams.
  
Something about current projects and how my data is being applied to cool new stuff.
  
My personal interests include:
  * Travel
  * Trail running
  * Trying new recipes
  * Knitting
  * Hiking
  * Playing uke in the forest
  * Trying new microbreweries on Vancouver Island
